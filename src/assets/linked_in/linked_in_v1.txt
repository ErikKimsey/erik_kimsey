My road from wanna-be academic to post-bacc pre-med to software engineer has been a long ride.  
//
So, now, I enjoy working creatively with technology.
//
I focus on web-based and mobile-web technology, design, and content.
//
I enjoy learning new languages and technology.  Especially, in order to put them to use in novel ways.
//
I want to be at the cross-section of interactivity, aesthetic-appeal, innovation, and good purpose.
